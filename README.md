![flasher xml slideshow](/screenshot.png)


This project along with [as3-transitions-lib](https://github.com/foo123/as3-transitions-lib) were initiated some years back,
in order to create a generic slideshow framework based on flash for mostly work and demo purposes

This project and (as3-transitions-lib) are still in progress (fully working nevertheless), but not developed anymore.

In any case the code is published in this repo and [as3-transitions-lib](https://github.com/foo123/as3-transitions-lib).
